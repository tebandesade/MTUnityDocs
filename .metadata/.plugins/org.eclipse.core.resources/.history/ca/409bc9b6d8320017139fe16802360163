BUG 1: Beginning Words
~  //in other words, it didn't begin with msgid|msgstr 
Cases found = 2608
FIXED --> Index that begins with either word
----------------------------------------------------------------------
BUG 2: The platform gives each "row" msg between " " (Like string type of data"
Cases -> All
FIXED -> Removes everything before the opening "
         "  " (Result format like this) then gets everything between first
         index and lastindex-1
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
BUG 3: Begining of words sometimes have format like
## XXXX
#### XXXX
Cases -> A lot, don't know exactly how much
Maybe a solution regex (FSA)

Thought: If this changes, the whole thing will changed when trying to map
the data again I.e if I want to put this to help my workflow. (THEORY)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUG 4: Size of output arrays different in some cases:
For the moment have true or false if size differs and its size
Would have to debug carefully
WorkAround -> NOOO 
	Skip it. Check how many it differs, check how many it doesn't

	According to a checker there are total 1349 pages, sizes of 308 don't match
	That's 22%
	Checker is two debug int variables that count at the end of leerArchivo.
Have to fix it. Check what pages there're. Added name attribute to page
				Saw pages with problems and created Bug6
FIXED: Bug6 was related to this. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUG 5: Saw that the name of the pages was es.po (name of file) when passed to 
	 debug last problem
FIXED: Added parameter name to Pagina refering to the page's name which is
	   the parent directory of the file being passed to the LeerArchivo 
	   function 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUG 6: Your platform until now works like the first two sentences (MSGID and STR)
     are blank (FORMAT). Don't take into consideration the ones that aren't
     translated. (EMPTY MSGSTR) (Hypothesis)
     
     DevelopmentData: xbox360-titleupdates.edit (bug6.txt)
     						Show data that hasn't been translated
     			      android-OBBsupport        (bug60.txt)
     The hypo stating corresponds to what is said with bug6.txt data 
     			(Data not being translated)
     Would be better to have a more organized pipeline
     	Read files and while you find msgid add to msgid array
     	Read files and while you find msgstr add to msgstr array
     	Supposes there're the same amount of msgid/msgstr pairs
     Workaround boolean flag to check if the less than two size is msgtr
     and if it is, it isn't translated
     FIXED with workaround and it's directly related to BUG4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUG 7: When I'm writing the file, there wasn't any text in the output file
	   Quick fix, had comment out some code in Pagina
	   However, now when I'm trying to print to the page, an error occurs.
	   NULL POINTER --> Approach that i was doing was debugging in console.              		  
	   FIXED : PAGINAS wasn't initialized.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
IDEA: Instead of passing references (int 1, int 2)
      private int1;
      private int2;
      
      and each time saveIt. For example in Ngram you can pass the sentences through
      the constructor, save them in a class attribute and modify them according
      Later add it .. //CHECK IF THIS IS THE DISCUSSION BETWEEN PASSING REFERENCE
      AND PASSING VALUE
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUG 8: NGrams (function implemented) is not working correctly, sometimes the arraylist
	   it has to create for each language is of the same size but has problems because the
	   size means that it's the same ngram
	   PFIXED: Wrong initialization of String[3], was getting the reference
BUG 9: This could be seen thanks to bug8. It appears the sentences have different sizes
        It was product of the testing data. Will run.
        FIXED:Appears to be fixed
---------------------------------------------------------------------------    
BUG 0: Se plane√≥ e hizo mal esto. Se supone que la alineada se hace a partir de algoritmo (eeem)
	   Usted lo que hizo fue coger crear ngrams y alinearlos arbitrariamente para luego que se
	   calculara una probabilidad y se cogiera la probabilidad mayor.

BUG 0.1: fuzzy words. In other words, if the translations are bad, it makes the system not 
		work. This is because it relies in StanfordCoreNLP and the implementation is specific
		to this problem and there're problems with the edge cases (fuzzy)
		There are 31,801 pair of sentences
		There are 2875 that have fuzzy counts for 4% 
		Have to remove this and see if the system works better to see if size of
		Ngrams is the same.
