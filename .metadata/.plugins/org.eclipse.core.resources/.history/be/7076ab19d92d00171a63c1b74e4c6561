Beginning Words
~  //in other words, it didn't begin with msgid|msgstr 
Cases found = 2608
FIXED --> Index that begins with either word
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The platform gives each "row" msg between " " (Like string type of data"
Cases -> All
FIXED -> Removes everything before the opening "
         "  " (Result format like this) then gets everything between first
         index and lastindex-1
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Begining of words sometimes have format like
## XXXX
#### XXXX
Cases -> A lot, don't know exactly how much
Maybe a solution regex (FSA)

Thought: If this changes, the whole thing will changed when trying to map
the data again I.e if I want to put this to help my workflow. (THEORY)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Size of output arrays different in some cases:
For the moment have true or false if size differs and its size
Would have to debug carefully
WorkAround -> 
	Skip it. Check how many it differs, check how many it doesn't

	According to a checker there are total 1349 pages, sizes of 308 don't match
	That's 22%
	Checker is two debug int variables that count at the end of leerArchivo.
	Have to fix it. Check what pages there're. Added name attribute to page
