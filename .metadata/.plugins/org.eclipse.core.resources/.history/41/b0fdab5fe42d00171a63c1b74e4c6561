BUG 1: Beginning Words
~  //in other words, it didn't begin with msgid|msgstr 
Cases found = 2608
FIXED --> Index that begins with either word
----------------------------------------------------------------------
BUG 2: The platform gives each "row" msg between " " (Like string type of data"
Cases -> All
FIXED -> Removes everything before the opening "
         "  " (Result format like this) then gets everything between first
         index and lastindex-1
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
BUG 3: Begining of words sometimes have format like
## XXXX
#### XXXX
Cases -> A lot, don't know exactly how much
Maybe a solution regex (FSA)

Thought: If this changes, the whole thing will changed when trying to map
the data again I.e if I want to put this to help my workflow. (THEORY)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUG 4: Size of output arrays different in some cases:
For the moment have true or false if size differs and its size
Would have to debug carefully
WorkAround -> NOOO 
	Skip it. Check how many it differs, check how many it doesn't

	According to a checker there are total 1349 pages, sizes of 308 don't match
	That's 22%
	Checker is two debug int variables that count at the end of leerArchivo.
Have to fix it. Check what pages there're. Added name attribute to page
				Saw pages with problems and created Bug6
FIXED: Bug6 was related to this. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUG 5: Saw that the name of the pages was es.po (name of file) when passed to 
	 debug last problem
FIXED: Added parameter name to Pagina refering to the page's name which is
	   the parent directory of the file being passed to the LeerArchivo 
	   function 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUG 6: Your platform until now works like the first two sentences (MSGID and STR)
     are blank (FORMAT). Don't take into consideration the ones that aren't
     translated. (EMPTY MSGSTR) (Hypothesis)
     
     DevelopmentData: xbox360-titleupdates.edit (bug6.txt)
     			      android-OBBsupport        (bug60.txt)
     The hypo stating corresponds to what is said with bug6.txt data
     Would be better to have a more organized pipeline
     	Read files and while you find msgid add to msgid array
     	Read files and while you find msgstr add to msgstr array
     	Supposes there're the same amount of msgid/msgstr pairs
     Workaround boolean flag to check if the less than two size is msgtr
     and if it is, it isn't translated
     FIXED with workaround and it's directly related to BUG4
